# Pattern Tesselation

A clickable grid of cells that recieve a random colour when clicked. A button enables the pattern to be rotated 90, this updates the rest of the tesselated patterns. Additionally, there is a clear button that empties the array, and subsequently the pattern.

Available for demo on my [website](www.maxpetts.me)
